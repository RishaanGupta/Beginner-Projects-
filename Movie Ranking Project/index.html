  <h3 class="jurassicParkTitle">Jurassic Park</h3>
  <p>I like Jurassic Park because it has a lot of action and a lot of survival things. I just really like the entire theme of surviving in the wilderness so I think that Jurassic Park is one of the best movies made to this day.</p>
  <h3>Thor</h3>
  <p>Ah, the classic first Thor movie. I hope that everybody has watched this. The iconic moments, the wondrous journey of Thor regaining his powers. Especially the spell that Odin placed on Thor's hammer, Mjolnr. It's just such an amazing movie and definitely ranks as one of my favorite ones. </p>
  <h3>DC's Legends of Tomorrow</h3>
  <p>While this is not a movie, I just love it so much that I am going to include it here anyways. Everything from the sheer technological coolness and the satisfying words of Rip Hunter make this movie a big competitor for all others.</p>
